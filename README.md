   - Contributions
    
       Authors summarize their contributuions to gaze estimation problem with three main points:
    
       * They propose an approach that relies solely on the relative positions of  facial keypoints
         to estimate gaze direction. 

       * Estimation uncertainity is also given with gaze direction prediction.
         (???Bayesian neural networks and aleatoric uncertainty)

       * Confidence gated units is introduced to disregard faceial keypoint detections for which 
         a low confidence level is provided.

   * Proposed Approach
        
        OpenPose is used to detect anatomical keypoints of all the persons preson in the scene.
