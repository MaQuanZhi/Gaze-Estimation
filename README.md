### a. Gaze Estimation for Assisted Living Environments(WACV-2020)

Authors summarize their contributuions to gaze estimation problem with three main points:

  - i.   They propose an approach that relies solely on the relative positions of  facial keypoints
       to estimate gaze direction. 
     
  - ii.  Estimation uncertainity is also given with gaze direction prediction.
       (???Bayesian neural networks and aleatoric uncertainty)
     
  - iii. Confidence gated units is introduced to disregard faceial keypoint detections for which 
       a low confidence level is provided.
