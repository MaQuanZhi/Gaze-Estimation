### 1. Gaze Estimation for Assisted Living Environments(WACV-2020)
    
   * Contributions
    
    * Authors summarize their contributuions to gaze estimation problem with three main points:
    
     * They propose an approach that relies solely on the relative positions of  facial keypoints
         to estimate gaze direction. 

     * Estimation uncertainity is also given with gaze direction prediction.
         (???Bayesian neural networks and aleatoric uncertainty)

     * Confidence gated units is introduced to disregard faceial keypoint detections for which 
         a low confidence level is provided.

   * Proposed Approach
