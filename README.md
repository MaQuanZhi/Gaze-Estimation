- ### a. Gaze Estimation for Assisted Living Environments(WACV-2020)

        Authors summarize their contributuions to gaze estimation problem with three main points:

        -  They propose an approach that relies solely on the relative positions of  facial keypoints
             to estimate gaze direction. 

        -   Estimation uncertainity is also given with gaze direction prediction.
             (???Bayesian neural networks and aleatoric uncertainty)

        -  Confidence gated units is introduced to disregard faceial keypoint detections for which 
             a low confidence level is provided.
